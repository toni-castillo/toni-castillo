### Hi, welcome! 👋

#### I'm Toni Castillo, a newbie full stack developer. 🤓

I have studied the **Full Stack Web Development** bootcamp at CodeHouse Academy, combining it with a part-time job, in which besides starting from the basics with **HTML** and **CSS**, learning the fundamentals of programming with **JavaScript** and working with **Angular**, we have done projects with **Node.js** and **Express**, created **MySQL** and **MongoDB** databases, styled with **Bootstrap** and **Saas**, managed version control with **Git** and applied **Scrum** for agile development.

- 💡 I have extensive skills in digital environments due to my professional background as a tech journalist and my love for technology, I know what it's like to work remotely for years and teamwork.
- 🌱 My objective is to continue acquiring knowledge and skills, consolidate them and, of course, apply them in a company as a developer —either frontend or backend— giving the best of myself.
